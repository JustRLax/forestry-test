  short_biography: My name's Jordan, and I'm designer and a developer who likes creating things, and solving problems.
  long_biography: I'm from a small town in Illinois about two hours west of Chicago. I started making things on and for the internet in 2010 after taking a intro to PHP class. While my work started off as focused on working with databases, and making wordpress due my bidding, I ended up enjoying designing things just as much as building them. I'm currently working as a designer and developer for SolidDigital.
